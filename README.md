# TinyML on RISC-V FPGA - IIT Roorkee Project

This repository contains the work for a project focused on implementing Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) models on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform utilizing the RISC-V architecture. This project appears to be part of academic work completed at IIT Roorkee.

The core of this project involves running machine learning models, likely optimized with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, on low-power embedded systems[1]. FPGAs provide a flexible hardware platform for accelerating such AI workloads, offering low latency and efficiency[2][3].

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of embedded systems and machine learning, a field often referred to as TinyML[1]. The goal is to deploy lightweight ML models on an FPGA. The use of a RISC-V System on Chip (SoC) provides an open-source and configurable processor core for managing the system and running the software stack, including the TensorFlow Lite Micro interpreter[2].

The primary components of this work include:
*   Training and quantizing a neural network.
*   Developing and/or using a RISC-V SoC for the FPGA.
*   Deploying and running the ML model for inference on the hardware.
*   Creating models for Arduino-compatible hardware, possibly using a platform like Edge Impulse.

## Getting Started

To explore this project, you will need tools and knowledge related to FPGAs, RISC-V, and TinyML.

### Prerequisites
*   An FPGA development board.
*   FPGA development software (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Intel Quartus).
*   Tools for RISC-V software development.
*   Python environment with TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite.
*   An Arduino IDE and compatible hardware for the Arduino-based models.

### Installation & Usage
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/amanchauhan786/RVFpga-TinyML-Work-IIT_ROORKEE-.git
    ```
2.  **Review the Documentation:** Start by reading the `Final_Report_CoDA_LAb.pdf` and the weekly reports to understand the project's scope and implementation details.
3.  **Explore the Model:** Open the `TFlite.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment to see how the machine learning model was developed and prepared for deployment.
4.  **Hardware Deployment:** The final report should contain instructions for synthesizing the hardware design and running it on a target FPGA.
