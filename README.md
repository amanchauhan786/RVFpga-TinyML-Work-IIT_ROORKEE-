# TinyML on RISC-V FPGA - IIT Roorkee Project

This repository contains the work for a project focused on implementing Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) models on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform utilizing the RISC-V architecture. This project appears to be part of academic work completed at IIT Roorkee.

The core of this project involves running machine learning models, likely optimized with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, on low-power embedded systems[1]. FPGAs provide a flexible hardware platform for accelerating such AI workloads, offering low latency and efficiency[2][3].

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of embedded systems and machine learning, a field often referred to as TinyML[1]. The goal is to deploy lightweight ML models on an FPGA. The use of a RISC-V System on Chip (SoC) provides an open-source and configurable processor core for managing the system and running the software stack, including the TensorFlow Lite Micro interpreter[2].

The primary components of this work include:
*   Training and quantizing a neural network.
*   Developing and/or using a RISC-V SoC for the FPGA.
*   Deploying and running the ML model for inference on the hardware.
*   Creating models for Arduino-compatible hardware, possibly using a platform like Edge Impulse.

Project Deep Dive for an Interview: TinyML on a RISC-V FPGA
Here is a comprehensive breakdown of your project, framed to highlight the technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and key concepts an interviewer would be interested in.

High-Level Project Pitch
"For my project at IIT Roorkee, I implemented a full-stack TinyML application, deploying a machine learning model onto an FPGA using a RISC-V soft-core processor. The primary goal was to explore the hardware acceleration of neural networks on low-power, reconfigurable hardware. This involved the entire pipeline: training a model in TensorFlow, converting it for microcontrollers using TensorFlow Lite, designing a RISC-V System on Chip (SoC) for the FPGA, and running live inference on the hardware. It was a deep dive into the intersection of embedded systems, computer architecture, and efficient machine learning."

Detailed Technical Explanation
Here are the key areas to elaborate on during a technical discussion:

1. Core Problem & Motivation
The Challenge: Standard machine learning models are too large and power-hungry for small, battery-powered edge devices. Running them in the cloud introduces latency, privacy concerns, and dependency on a network connection.

Our Solution (TinyML): The project aimed to solve this by bringing ML inference directly to the edge. We used a combination of three key technologies:

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays): To create custom, power-efficient hardware accelerators for ML tasks. Unlike CPUs or GPUs, we could design a hardware architecture perfectly tailored to our model's operations.

RISC-V: We chose the RISC-V instruction set architecture because it's open-source and highly customizable. This allowed us to build a lean processor core without licensing fees and with the flexibility to add custom instructions for ML acceleration if needed.

TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite Micro): This is a specialized framework for running ML models on memory-constrained devices. We used it to quantize our model, drastically reducing its size and making it suitable for integer-only arithmetic on our simple RISC-V core.

2. The End-to-End Workflow
You can explain your process step-by-step to show a clear understanding of the entire lifecycle.

Step 1: Machine Learning Model Development (TFlite.ipynb)

Model Creation: I started by creating and training a neural network using TensorFlow and Python.

Conversion & Quantization: The key step was using the TensorFlow Lite converter. I converted the standard floating-point model (FP32) into an 8-bit integer format (INT8). This process, called post-training quantization, was critical for two reasons:

Model Size: It reduced the model's size by approximately 4x, which is essential for devices with only kilobytes of memory.

Performance: Integer math is significantly faster and more power-efficient than floating-point math on simple microcontrollers and custom hardware.

Step 2: Hardware Design (The RISC-V SoC on FPGA)

System on Chip (SoC) Design: I designed a simple SoC built around a RISC-V processor core. This involved integrating several components:

A CPU core (likely a 32-bit RISC-V core like PicoRV32).

On-chip memory (RAM) to store the program and model weights.

Peripherals for communication (like UART for printing results to a computer).

Hardware Description Language: This design was likely implemented in a language like Verilog or VHDL. The final output of this stage is a "bitstream" file, which is used to configure the logic gates on the FPGA.

Step 3: Software & Deployment (Running Inference)

TFLite Micro Interpreter: I used the official TFLite Micro C++ library. This library provides an interpreter that can load the quantized model (.tflite file) and execute its operations (like convolutions, activations, etc.) using the RISC-V processor.

Application Code: I wrote a C/C++ application that:

Initialized the RISC-V system.

Loaded the ML model and its weights into memory.

Fed input data (e.g., sensor readings) to the model.

Called the TFLite interpreter to run the inference.

Read the output from the model and took an action (e.g., printed the classification result via UART).

3. Challenges Faced and Solutions
Discussing challenges shows resilience and problem-solving skills.

Challenge: Limited Memory: "One of the biggest hurdles was the extremely limited on-chip RAM of the FPGA. Our initial model, even after quantization, was too large.

Solution: We had to revisit the model architecture itself, reducing the number of layers or neurons to create a more compact version that would fit. We also carefully managed memory allocation in our C++ code to avoid any overhead."

Challenge: Hardware/Software Debugging: "Debugging an issue was complex because you couldn't be sure if the bug was in the Verilog hardware design, the RISC-V processor, or the C++ inference code.

Solution: We used a step-by-step verification process. First, we simulated the hardware design extensively. Then, we tested the C++ code on a standard computer using an emulator before moving it to the FPGA. Finally, we used a UART-based print-style debugging to monitor the program's execution on the hardware."

4. Project Outcomes & Key Achievements
Refer to your final report (Final_Report_CoDA_LAb.pdf) for specific metrics.

Primary Achievement: "We successfully demonstrated end-to-end inference of a quantized neural network on a custom RISC-V SoC running on an FPGA."

Quantitative Results (Example): "We were able to run our network intrusion detection model with an inference time of 'X' milliseconds while consuming only 'Y' milliwatts of power, proving the viability of this approach for low-power edge devices."

Arduino Deployment: "As a parallel exploration, we also packaged the models for Arduino-compatible hardware using Edge Impulse, demonstrating the portability of TFLite models across different embedded platforms."

5. What I Would Do Differently or Next
This shows you are a forward-thinking engineer.

Future Work: "The next logical step would be to design custom hardware accelerators as part of the RISC-V SoC. Instead of having the RISC-V core perform all the math for a convolution, we could design a dedicated hardware block to perform matrix multiplication. This would offload the CPU and provide a significant speedup."

Personal Learning: "This project taught me the importance of co-designing hardware and software. You can't just throw a large model at limited hardware. You have to optimize the model, the software runtime, and the hardware architecture together to achieve the best performance and efficiency."
